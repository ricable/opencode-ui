The Agent User Interaction Protocol is rapidly evolving. This page outlines our
current thinking on key priorities and future direction.

<Note>
  The ideas presented here are not commitmentsâ€”we may solve these challenges
  differently than described, or some may not materialize at all. This is also
  not an _exhaustive_ list; we may incorporate work that isn't mentioned here.
