# @ag-ui/client

The Agent User Interaction Protocol Client SDK provides agent connectivity
options for AI systems. This package builds on the core types and events to
deliver flexible connection methods to agent implementations.

```bash
npm install @ag-ui/client
```

## AbstractAgent

`AbstractAgent` is the base agent class for implementing custom agent
connectivity. Extending this class and implementing `run()` lets you bridge your
own service or agent implementation to AG-UI.

- [Configuration](/sdk/js/client/abstract-agent#configuration) - Setup with
  agent ID, messages, and state
- [Core Methods](/sdk/js/client/abstract-agent#core-methods) - Run, abort, and
  clone functionality
- [Protected Methods](/sdk/js/client/abstract-agent#protected-methods) -
  Extensible hooks for custom implementations
- [Properties](/sdk/js/client/abstract-agent#properties) - State and message
  tracking

## HttpAgent

Concrete implementation for HTTP-based agent connectivity:

- [Configuration](/sdk/js/client/http-agent#configuration) - URL and header
  setup
- [Methods](/sdk/js/client/http-agent#methods) - HTTP-specific execution and
  cancellation
- [Protected Methods](/sdk/js/client/http-agent#protected-methods) -
  Customizable HTTP request handling
- [Properties](/sdk/js/client/http-agent#properties) - Connection management
