# Debugging AG-UI Integrations

Debugging agent-based applications can be challenging, especially when working
with real-time, event-driven protocols like AG-UI. This guide introduces you to
the AG-UI Dojo, a powerful tool for learning, testing, and debugging your AG-UI
implementations.

## The AG-UI Dojo

The AG-UI Dojo is the best way to bring AG-UI to a new surface, and is also an
excellent resource for learning about the protocol's basic capabilities. It
provides a structured environment where you can test and validate each component
of the AG-UI protocol.

### What is the Dojo?

The Dojo consists of a series of "hello world"-sized demonstrations for the
different building blocks available via AG-UI. Each demonstration:

1. Shows a specific AG-UI capability in action
2. Presents both the user-visible interaction and the underlying code side by
   side
3. Allows you to test and verify your implementation

### Using the Dojo as an Implementation Checklist

When working on bringing AG-UI to a new surface or platform, you can use the
Dojo as a comprehensive "todo list":

1. Work through each demonstration one by one
2. Implement and test each AG-UI building block in your environment
3. When all demonstrations work correctly in your implementation, you can be
   confident that full-featured copilots and agent-native applications can be
   built on your new surface

This methodical approach ensures you've covered all the necessary functionality
required for a complete AG-UI implementation.

### Using the Dojo as a Learning Resource

For developers new to AG-UI, the Dojo serves as an interactive learning
resource:

- Each item demonstrates a specific AG-UI capability
- You can see both what the interaction looks like from a user perspective
- The underlying code is shown alongside, helping you understand how it works
- The incremental complexity helps build understanding from basics to advanced
  features

### Common Debugging Patterns

When using the Dojo for debugging your AG-UI implementation, keep these patterns
in mind:

1. **Event Sequence Issues**: Verify that events are being emitted in the
   correct order and with proper nesting (e.g., `TEXT_MESSAGE_START` before
   `TEXT_MESSAGE_CONTENT`)

2. **Data Format Problems**: Ensure your event payloads match the expected
   structure for each event type

3. **Transport Layer Debugging**: Check that your chosen transport mechanism
   (SSE, WebSockets, etc.) is correctly delivering events

4. **State Synchronization**: Confirm that state updates are correctly applied
   using snapshots and deltas

5. **Tool Execution**: Verify that tool calls and responses are properly
   formatted and processed

## Getting Started with the Dojo

To start using the AG-UI Dojo:

1. Clone the repository from
   [github.com/ag-ui-protocol/dojo](https://github.com/ag-ui-protocol/dojo)
2. Follow the setup instructions in the README
3. Start working through the demonstrations in order
4. Use the provided test cases to validate your implementation

The Dojo's structured approach makes it an invaluable resource for both learning
AG-UI and ensuring your implementation meets all requirements.
