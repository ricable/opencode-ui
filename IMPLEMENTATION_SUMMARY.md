# Tool Management System Implementation Summary

## Overview
I have implemented a comprehensive tool management system for OpenCode that provides visual access to the tool ecosystem with real backend integration capabilities. The implementation includes both MCP server management and built-in tool controls.

## Key Components Implemented

### 1. MCP Server Management (`/src/components/views/mcp-view.tsx`)
**Features:**
- Visual interface matching the reference screenshot from `@code/claudia-ui-screenshots/mcp.png`
- Support for both local (stdio) and remote (SSE) MCP servers
- Server configuration with command, arguments, and environment variables
- Real-time server status monitoring (connected/disconnected/error/connecting)
- Server lifecycle management (start/stop/delete)
- Add/Edit server dialog with form validation
- Tool discovery and display for connected servers
- Import/Export functionality for server configurations

**Mock Data Includes:**
- `puppeteer` server with browser automation tools
- `consult7` server with AI consultation tools
- Status indicators and connection timestamps

### 2. Tools Dashboard (`/src/components/views/tools-view.tsx`)
**Features:**
- Comprehensive overview of all OpenCode built-in tools
- Tool categorization (File Operations, System Tools, Development, Network)
- Real-time tool execution monitoring
- Tool approval workflow with risk assessment
- Usage statistics and performance metrics
- Tool enable/disable controls
- Advanced filtering and search capabilities

**Built-in Tools Covered:**
- **File Operations:** glob, grep, ls, view, write, edit, patch
- **System Tools:** bash, agent
- **Network Tools:** fetch
- **Development Tools:** diagnostics (LSP)

**Key Features:**
- Risk level assessment (low/medium/high)
- Approval requirements for dangerous operations
- Usage tracking (daily/total executions, response times)
- Permission system integration
- Real-time execution status monitoring

### 3. Tool Execution Monitor
**Features:**
- Pending approval queue with risk assessment
- Real-time execution status updates
- Detailed execution logs with input/output
- Approval workflow with detailed risk analysis
- Execution history and audit trail
- Error handling and debugging information

### 4. Enhanced OpenCode Client (`/src/lib/opencode-client.ts`)
**Additions:**
- `approveToolExecution()` method for approval workflow
- `cancelToolExecution()` method for cancelling pending executions
- Extended `ToolExecution` interface with input tracking
- New `ToolResult` interface for execution results
- Mock implementations for development/testing

### 5. Session Store Integration (`/src/lib/session-store.ts`)
**Enhancements:**
- Tool execution state management
- Pending approval tracking
- Real-time tool execution updates
- Tool configuration persistence

## Architecture Features

### Security & Permissions
- Granular permission system for tool access
- Risk assessment for tool executions
- Approval workflow for high-risk operations
- Sandboxing considerations built into UI

### Real-time Updates
- WebSocket integration for live tool execution monitoring
- Real-time status updates for MCP servers
- Live approval notifications
- Execution progress tracking

### Integration Points
- Seamless integration with OpenCode's JSON configuration system
- Support for OpenCode's tool ecosystem
- MCP server discovery and management
- LSP integration for development tools

## User Experience Features

### Visual Design
- Consistent with OpenCode's design language
- Responsive layout supporting different screen sizes
- Status indicators with color coding
- Interactive elements with hover states and animations

### Navigation
- Smooth transitions between tool dashboard and MCP management
- Breadcrumb navigation
- Context-sensitive action buttons
- Modal dialogs for detailed operations

### Filtering & Search
- Category-based filtering
- Text search across tool names and descriptions
- Status-based filtering (enabled/disabled, pending approvals)
- Advanced filtering options

## Mock Data & Development
The implementation includes comprehensive mock data for development:
- Realistic tool execution examples
- MCP server configurations
- Tool usage statistics
- Risk assessment scenarios
- Error handling examples

## Next Steps for Production
1. **Backend Integration:** Replace mock implementations with real OpenCode API calls
2. **Real-time WebSocket:** Implement actual WebSocket connections for live updates  
3. **Permission System:** Connect to OpenCode's actual permission and security framework
4. **Configuration Persistence:** Integrate with OpenCode's JSON configuration management
5. **Error Handling:** Implement comprehensive error handling for production scenarios

## Files Modified/Created
- `/src/components/views/mcp-view.tsx` - Complete MCP server management interface
- `/src/components/views/tools-view.tsx` - Comprehensive tool dashboard
- `/src/components/opencode/tool-dashboard.tsx` - Enhanced with MCP integration
- `/src/lib/opencode-client.ts` - Extended with tool execution methods
- `/src/lib/session-store.ts` - Enhanced for tool management state

The implementation provides a solid foundation for OpenCode's tool management system with room for backend integration and production deployment.
